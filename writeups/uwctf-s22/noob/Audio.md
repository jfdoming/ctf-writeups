## Solution

Upon downloading the attached audio file and listening to it, it is clear that the audio has been scrambled in some way. By reversing the audio, one can hear that it is a recording of a voice speaking quite quickly. After slowing the recording down, we obtain a [new recording](attachments/Audio/whoops_slow.mp3) of a voice saying a bunch of words from the [NATO phonetic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet). Listening for the first letter of each word, the voice spells out a flag.
