## Solution

Based on the message that greets you upon entering the hint command (as well as the source code), we probably need to overflow a buffer in the program:

```
Welcome to Buffer Overflow 0
Can you hack me?
```

A good first thing to try with buffer overflows is overflowing the buffer (ðŸ˜›). In this case, that's actually all that's needed! Typing `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA` and pressing enter immediately prints the flag.
