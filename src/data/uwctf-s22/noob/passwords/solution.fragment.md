The hardest part of this challenge was getting the executable to run! ðŸ˜ž

We're told this is a C program, so we know we need to find a way to run this on the correct platform. Inspecting the first few bytes of the executable reveals it's a file in [ELF format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format), which is common on Unix systems. After pulling down a few assorted docker images, the latest Arch Linux image is able to run this executable. We see:

```
Password:
```

Inspecting the executable binary again and searching for "Password:", we see the string "correct_horse_battery_staple" (classic). Trying this as the password and sending `EOF` (`CTRL-D`) prints the flag (a lot).

Side note: I never did figure out the mistake Charlie made...
